# SMILE

This project is being developed at the request of a Metaphysical
practitioner who has a need for various tools she uses to be
computerized and accessible securely from anywhere with an Internet
connection.

Currently this project consists of a Rosecrucian module and a
Numerology module. Additional modules should be added as the
practitioner requests them.

The Rosecrucian module divides a year, presumably starting on a
client's birthday, into 7 more or less equal periods and lists
these periods out. According to the Rosecrucians, each period of a
person's year is especially good and especially bad for various types
of activity and actions. Having them listed out helps the practitioner
to advise her clients accordingly.

The Numerology module performs a numerological analysis on a word or
phrase. It converts each character into it's numerological position
in the alphabet, sums them up, and reduces that number to a single 
digit. These single digits hold significance to the practitioner and
can be useful in her practice and in advising her clients.

Additional modules, to be determined by the practitioner, may include
astrological and zodiac analyzers, as well as a client information database.
